Analysis Description
--------------------
Examine whether or not a codon alignment is better fit by models which
permit multiple instantaneous substitutions. v0.2 adds a separate rate
for codon-island triple-hit rates

- __Requirements__: in-frame codon alignment and a phylogenetic tree

>code –> Universal

>Loaded a multiple sequence alignment with **15** sequences, **610** codons, and **1** partitions from `/home/datamonkey/datamonkey-js-server/production/app/multihit/output/5eb328124f869d08f96d009d`
The number of omega rate classes to include in the model (permissible range = [1,10], default value = 3, integer):

>triple-islands –> Yes


### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model

>kill-zero-lengths –> Yes
* Log(L) = -10085.04, AIC-c = 20240.16 (35 estimated parameters)

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -9554.71, AIC-c = 19193.81 (42 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.2332

### Fitting Standard MG94
* Log(L) = -9492.34, AIC-c = 19069.07 (42 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio =   0.1740

### Fitting MG94 with double instantaneous substitutions
* Log(L) = -9382.64, AIC-c = 18851.69 (43 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio =   0.1114
* rate at which 2 nucleotides are changed instantly within a single codon =   0.6194

### Fitting MG94 with double and triple instantaneous substitutions
